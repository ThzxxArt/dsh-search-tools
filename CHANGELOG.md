# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

### Added

- Adapter-first core: `ctx.searchTools` registry, stable search/fetch dispatchers,
  manifest-driven settings metadata.
- SearXNG search adapter skeleton: config validation, JSON/HTML parsing, auth
  lookup, failover, pagination, cache, probe.
- Readability HTTP fetch adapter skeleton: DSH safe fetch, lazy jsdom/Readability,
  fail-open extraction.
- `web_research` tool and conversation card.
- Settings section registration (`settings.section`) and authenticated host
  routes for status, adapters, probe, search preview, fetch preview, cache clear.
- YAML-backed config through DSH settings; credentials-backed secrets.
- Project skeleton: TypeScript, tsdown host/client builds, Vitest, CI/release
  workflows, bilingual README, MIT license.

### Verified

- M0 on DSH `0.2.1-rc.2`: Settings → Search Tools renders; Save writes
  `cordis.patch.yml`; authenticated routes return 401 without the browser
  cookie and 200 with it; probe/search-preview work against a mock SearXNG;
  search/fetch takeover and restore work; secret write stays out of YAML.
  Details: `docs/m0-verification.md`.

### Fixed during M0

- Resolve credentials per request instead of capturing them at plugin apply.
- Read the `{ ok, value }` envelope from `remote.credentials.describe`.
- Render write-only secret fields from `manifest.secretRefs`.
- Require a passing search test before search takeover and restore the previous
  provider on disable.
- Allow an empty instance list when takeover is off.
- Localize page copy and adapter manifests for `zh` / `en`.
- Rebuild the LRU when cache bounds change; wire `undici.ProxyAgent`.
- Validate a missing `userAgent` against the adapter default.
- Use linkedom instead of jsdom for Readability: jsdom's `tr46` dependency
  calls `createRequire(...).resolve.paths`, which DSH's profile-resolution hook
  breaks; linkedom is smaller and works inside the Host.
- Add the `plugins.detail.section` takeover warning with a direct
  “disable takeover” action.
- Add per-instance probe buttons and an empty-state guide.
- Add localized adapter manifests so external adapters can ship `en` / `zh`
  labels without changing the page.
